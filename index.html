				<h1 class="title">Log4j and sudden glimpse of security awareness.</h1>
				<div class="meta">Dec 13, 2021</div>
			</div>

			<div class="markdown">
				<p>As any proper security panic, Log4j made everyone think of many things. Open-source economics, supply chain risks, interconnected risk bearing&hellip; kk.org&rsquo;s Kevin Kelly wrote a blog post that brings up the sentiment of &ldquo;enabling baseline via regulating everyone&rdquo;, again:</p>
<p><a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/your-security-is-my-security/">https://kk.org/thetechnium/your-security-is-my-security/</a></p>
<p>KK’s take on the problem? “We have to regulate security baseline by regulating each and every device that gets online”. Although not campaigning for serious standardisation and regulation, it&rsquo;s still a strong take. And since it&rsquo;s well written, it&rsquo;s interesting to argue against. Read it first, KK is an awesome writer first of all.</p>
<p>The point that struck me is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In effect we would treat a security break like a public health breach. Until you can upgrade your devices to the minimum required standard of security, you are quarantined.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… and it hits the right spot, although from the wrong direction.</p>
<p>I wanted to rant on COVID protocol compliance, but that’s a complicated and charged topic for 2021, so I’ll salt it until dust settles (2025?).</p>
<p>So let’s take a simpler example to discuss: drunk driving. We’ve got a “minimum required security standard” that implies that every driver can be held accountable for their actions. Yet in US, 28 people a day die in DUI crashes (<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving#:~:text=Every%20day%2C%20about%2028%20people,These%20deaths%20were%20all%20preventable.">Drunk Driving | NHTSA</a>). This is intentional misbehaviour only. Think of people on the road with sight problems, sleep fatigue and other causes for loss of driver control. They all sum up as “you should not be driving but here you are”.</p>
<p>Talking about information security in the interconnected society, there are a few problems with mandating security baseline from everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incentives are misaligned: There is no good single short-term incentive to invest into a security baseline that works well for everyone. Quite the opposite, the current climate incentivizes broken software in a way. It&rsquo;s always more important to ship it then to ship it risk free.</li>
<li>People’s judgement about risk is flawed to some extent: “I am driving well enough after a few beers” translates into “I am attentive enough to notice something wrong with my computer when I’m browsing porn on the outdated Internet Explorer with Windows Defender shut down because the updates take too long to download”.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect people to behave reasonably against probabilistic risks.</p>
<p>Some are insufficiently educated about the technology they operate. Some are not capable of assessing risks properly and making sane risk decisions. Some tend to oversimplify and ignore things because life is hard already. And they will stay online and interconnected with saner, more responsible people.</p>
<p>So, if we want to put in place the whole idea of “regulating everyone’s security baseline”, we need to pull control out of people’s hands to some extent:</p>
<ol>
<li>One way to deal with it is “access authorisation based on scanning your security posture”. Unreal for now, amazing technological challenge for the next 20 years, but not likely to be an easy win to get everyone to adopt it. Hard to do, easy to abuse.</li>
<li>(Extends 1) Ongoing monitoring that shows pre-generated evidence of security posture during session initiation of any kind. Hard to do, easy to abuse.</li>
<li>Device control. The easiest way to guarantee baseline compliance with close to 100% coverage is to enforce OS updates and config updates. If you don’t update your device, you lose compatibility with some novel features in your favourite apps. Perhaps your payments stop working or your instagram account gets automatically blocked as potential spammers. Device in your pocket and backpack stops feeling like you own it, even though you’ve paid for it. Easy to do, hard to abuse, you wouldn&rsquo;t like it anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, these things will only work with vulnerabilities and deficiencies that are known to platform controllers and described in detection and enforcement systems. Even if these systems work, and they get to establish the new fabric of trust, 0 days become instantly more detrimental.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good answer, only observation that obvious solutions to address don&rsquo;t seem to be attractive. Notions of individual responsibility, real-time risk decisions and zero trust will not satisfy too many souls looking for peace.</p>
<p>As they will be ignored, I only hope that we will live to the point where we will see proposals which address inherent human incapacity of risk judgement more directly, without triggering rejection. Before that, things will look grim.</p>
