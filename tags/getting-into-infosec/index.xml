      <description>I see many conversations around cybersecurity education, requirements to find work and gatekeeping. While I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to say about it, getting into them would me mildly unproductive, especially in environments crafted for argument, not finding new meanings and consensus. But this conversation got me on it again: https://twitter.com/kylieengineer/status/1482485311158779905, so I&amp;rsquo;d sketch something here. Perhaps, this will be continued in the future.
This particular example is “learning to fit into current security needs” vs “learning XX fundamentals” (CS, infra, risk, whatever).</description>
